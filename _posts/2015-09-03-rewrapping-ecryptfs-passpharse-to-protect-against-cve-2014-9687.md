## Why eCryptfs?

I have an [eCryptfs filesystem](http://ecryptfs.org/) I use to protect my sensitive data at rest in addition to full disk encryption via LUKS.  It's mounted only for a handful of hours a year.  The encrypted files are then backed-up seemlessly using traditional cloud backup services.

My setup works great and I feel confident that it's "good enough" for my needs to protect against malware on my computer for accessing sensitive files.

It's easy to use with the `ecryptfs-mount-private` and `ecryptfs-umount-private` commands.

## Security Issue with CVE-2014-9687

The salt wasn't randomly generated and allowed rainbow table attacks.  The time has apparently come and the rainbow table has been generated and published.  It's hosted on Github @ [kudelskisecurity/ecryptfs-dictionary-v1](https://github.com/kudelskisecurity/ecryptfs-dictionary-v1) with [corresponding write-up](http://cybermashup.com/2015/08/25/how-to-crack-ubuntu-disk-encryption-and-passwords/).

Time to rewrap my passphrase with a randomly generated salt to render the rainbow table useless.

It appears that eCryptfs had some primitive support for a manually generated salt with the `~/.ecryptfsrc` file but it wasn't automatically setup and likely largely unused.  A better approach is to always use a randomly generated salt and this was introduced with the v2 passphrase file that resolves CVE-2014-9687.  Details on this change are in [revision 839](http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ecryptfs/ecryptfs/trunk/revision/839).

## How Do I Rewrap My Passphrase?

### Step 1 - Check File Version

Determine if your wrapped passphrase file is version 1 or version 2.  According to [read_wrapped_passphrase_file_version()]( http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ecryptfs/ecryptfs/trunk/view/head:/src/libecryptfs/key_management.c#L300) a version 2 file will begin with an ASCII `:` followed by `0x2` and an unversioned file will have ASCII hex data.  Anything larger then v2 currently is unsupported.

Use `xxd` or `hexdump` to check.  Mine original v1 passphrase file for reference:

    $ xxd -l 2 ~/.ecryptfs/wrapped-passphrase
    00000000: 3065                                     0e

Looks like version 1 to me.  The file size was *48* bytes.

### Step 2 - Backup

Copy the file to be safe in case the rewrap goes bad:

    $ cp ~/.ecryptfs/wrapped-passphrase ~/.ecryptfs/wrapped-passphrase.bak

### Step 3 - Rewrap

    $ ecryptfs-rewrap-passphrase ~/.ecryptfs/wrapped-passphrase
    Old wrapping passphrase:
    New wrapping passphrase:
    New wrapping passphrase (again):

### Step 4 - Check

If everything went according to plan the file should now begin with ASCII `:` followed by `0x2`:

    $ xxd -l 2 ~/.ecryptfs/wrapped-passphrase
    00000000: 3a02                                     :.

Looks good, file size is now *58* bytes.

For the truly paranoid, running the rewrap again with the same passphrase will generate a file with different contents as the salt should have changed.

### Step 5 - Test

Mount the the filesystem with `ecryptfs-mount-private` or similar to verify.

### Step 6 - Clean-up

Only clean-up once you know the new passphrase is working!  And be thorough about it:

    $ shred -vu ~/.ecryptfs/wrapped-passphrase.bak
