No more consumer routers!
-------------------------

A while ago I dumped my consumer NAT router in favor of using my desktop router.  I do most of my work at my apartment on my desktop, so why not make it my router and file server?  Great question, great choice.  No longer am I restricted by buggy firmware, half implemented DHCP or DNS servers, NAT limitations, etc.  I demoted by Linksys WRT54G running DD-WRT to just AP roles which lasted for a few more years before the hardware finally died.  RIP WRT54G, you outlived your useful life while delivering above and beyond my expectations.

My Linux desktop / server with an additional Intel PCIe NIC and Linux NAT capabilities make a pretty awesome combination.  Add dnsmasq for simple DHCP, DNS and sometimes TFTP capabilities.  No more consumer routers, the last thing I need is more stuff to configure.

Enter the Ubiquiti PicoStation2
-------------------------------

I read alot of good things about Ubiquiti a while ago when I was planning to build a quad copter and do cool things with Linux + Pandaboard.  The Picostation2 was supposed to be the high powered radio to control the who thing.  Life happened.  The quad never got built, but I didn't give up until after I bought a few pieces such as the Picostation2.  After my Linksys WRT54G died, the Picostation2 was put into action.  I was impressed by the polish of the AirOS web interface.  The Linux SDK seemed cool (until I learned how /old/ the kernel actually was).  But, all my devices (Mac Book Retina Pro, Nexus 4, Lenovo Thinkpad, etc) all had issues with the AP just not working that well.  The connection would just die.  I attempted to reconfigure it and fix it thinking it was my fault, but my attempts were in vain.

A work project demanded Wi-Fi access for some testing at home and the PicoStation2 was making this more difficult.  The PictionStation2 was then retired back to the drawer.

Linksys EA6400
--------------

I bought a Linksys EA6400 on sale thinking I could just replace my AP and be done.  Nope, never that simple.  Linksys created this "Smart Wi-Fi" feature that makes it a major pain to configure.  Just Google "Linksys Smart Wi-Fi" and see what people have to say about the "502 Bad Gateway" error the router constantly threw me whenever I tried to use it as a bridging access point.

Apparently Smart Wi-Fi phones home to Linksys's cloud to allow you to configure it from the web.  What if the Internet connection isn't configured?  Oh, use the included CD for Windows.  I don't even have an optical drive reader or easy access to Windows.  I did some tricks and got it to "kind of work" but not really.

I shipped it back several days later.  I'm done with Linksys and will likely never buy a Linksys product if this is the route they are going.  That's too bad, I loved my old WRT54G and was hoping the EA6400 would be similar.  I was wrong.

Linux + HostAPd + TL-WDN4800
----------------------------

Linux wireless is a lot more stable then it was several years ago, and host/software access points now work quite well.  This coupled with the idea that my desktop / server already runs my NAT, DNS, DHCP and this is a no brainer.  I looked in to buying a PCIe Wi-Fi card.

I settled on the TP-Link TL-WDN4800 card.  It features an Atheros AR9380 that can do 3 spatial streams, Short-GI, 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and HT40 (40 MHz channels).  When configured as a 5 GHz AP my rMBP connects to with a linksys of 450 Mbps.  I can't ask for any more.  Speed tests show over 100 Mb/s actual data rate.  Beyond that I didn't test much.  If I need speed faster then that I'll use gigabit Ethernet.  My Nexus 4 has only 1 spatial stream, and negotiates a bitrate of 72 Mbps, which is the fastest the device can do.  Did I mention the card was only $45 and the Ubuntu 12.10 + development Linux 3.9 kernel just works after a little hostapd config?  I paid 3x this for the EA6400 that barely worked (even though it was dual simultaneous band and had 802.11ac).

Back to Reality
---------------

While the 450 Mbps bitrate of 5 GHz + HT40 + Short-GI was nice, it didn't work with all my devices.  As a result I had to fall back to 2.4 GHz channels and HT20.  My rMBP now gets link speed of 217 Mb/s which is still pretty good.  Most of the time it will do in excess of 50 Mb/s of real world data throughput.  Plenty fast for web surfing.  My Nexus 4 is still happy at 72 Mb/s.

I also chose to create a separate subnet for my Wi-Fi clients.  This reduced broadcast traffic from my wired devices and helps keep the Wi-Fi channel a little quieter and improves performance slightly.  I also believe that people are ignorant and simply bridge devices because they don't understand routing and firewall rules.... but that's just me. :)
