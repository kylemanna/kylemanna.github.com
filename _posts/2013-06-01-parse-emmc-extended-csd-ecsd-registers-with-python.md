eMMC and Extended CSD Registers
-------------------------------

The other day I needed to read of the data from the Extended CSD (aka ECSD) registers of a eMMC chip I was having a disagreement with.  Linux makes this kind of easy with a kernal that has debugfs support enabled:

    $ mount -t debugfs debugfs /d
    $ cat /d/mmc0/mmc0:0001/ext_csd

Making sense of the 512 bytes string is another issue all together.
