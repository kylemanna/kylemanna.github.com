## Ubuntu 13.04 Upgrade + discard mount option for /

I upgrade to Ubuntu 13.04 the other week and it pretty much went without incident.  On a side note, I don't remember an upgrade going this smooth since before Unity was introduced.

Following the upgrade I wanted to enable TRIM support for my rootfs, so I added "discard" to the mount options.  I thought it would improve performance by sending the SSD TRIM commands when files were deleted.  I thought wrong and didn't notice initially, this caused me to blame btrfs and trying a number of other things with no success (btrfs balance, clear_cache, finally re-making the filesystem...).

Everytime I would write something on my SSD it was terribly slow.  For example, opening /etc/fstab with vim and writing it would take 5+ seconds.  Something was wrong.

Of course fstab is not a big file, and I'm not even writing any changes:

	-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1226 May  5 16:21 /etc/fstab

While it's hanging for a few seconds, lets look at where the vim code was hanging:

	$ sudo cat /proc/$(pidof vim)/stack 
	[<ffffffff8132c529>] blkdev_issue_discard+0x279/0x2a0
	[<ffffffffa016691c>] btrfs_discard_extent.isra.48+0x9c/0xf0 [btrfs]
	[<ffffffffa016f8c1>] btrfs_finish_extent_commit+0xc1/0xf0 [btrfs]
	[<ffffffffa01831c4>] btrfs_commit_transaction+0x974/0xac0 [btrfs]
	[<ffffffffa0192733>] btrfs_sync_file+0x193/0x230 [btrfs]
	[<ffffffff811c396d>] do_fsync+0x5d/0x90
	[<ffffffff811c3bd0>] sys_fsync+0x10/0x20
	[<ffffffff816d37dd>] system_call_fastpath+0x1a/0x1f
	[<ffffffffffffffff>] 0xffffffffffffffff

There we have the smoking gun... blkdev_issue_discard().  At first I thought it was btrfs being slow, but it was actually the discard code.  I thought the discard just marked deleted blocks for removal later, and then charged on.  Apparently it's blocking for some reason when vim calls fsync() after each write.

Closer investigation reverals that every btrfs sync does pretty much the same thing even with back to back syncs.  The second sync should be almost instantenous:

	$ sudo cat /proc/$(pidof btrfs)/stack
	[<ffffffff8132c529>] blkdev_issue_discard+0x279/0x2a0
	[<ffffffffa016691c>] btrfs_discard_extent.isra.48+0x9c/0xf0 [btrfs]
	[<ffffffffa016f8c1>] btrfs_finish_extent_commit+0xc1/0xf0 [btrfs]
	[<ffffffffa01831c4>] btrfs_commit_transaction+0x974/0xac0 [btrfs]
	[<ffffffffa01559ca>] btrfs_sync_fs+0x5a/0xc0 [btrfs]
	[<ffffffffa01b3385>] btrfs_ioctl+0x13c5/0x1b80 [btrfs]
	[<ffffffff811a5969>] do_vfs_ioctl+0x99/0x570
	[<ffffffff811a5ed1>] sys_ioctl+0x91/0xb0
	[<ffffffff816d37dd>] system_call_fastpath+0x1a/0x1f
	[<ffffffffffffffff>] 0xffffffffffffffff

	$ sudo sh -c "( time btrfs filesystem sync / ; time btrfs filesystem sync / )"
	FSSync '/'

	real	0m7.015s
	user	0m0.008s
	sys	0m0.000s
	FSSync '/'

	real	0m9.050s
	user	0m0.004s
	sys	0m0.008s

System wide sync is pretty much the same thing, but more drama on a pretty much idle system:

	$ cat /proc/$(pidof sync)/stack
	[<ffffffff8132c529>] blkdev_issue_discard+0x279/0x2a0
	[<ffffffffa016691c>] btrfs_discard_extent.isra.48+0x9c/0xf0 [btrfs]
	[<ffffffffa016f8c1>] btrfs_finish_extent_commit+0xc1/0xf0 [btrfs]
	[<ffffffffa01831c4>] btrfs_commit_transaction+0x974/0xac0 [btrfs]
	[<ffffffffa01559ca>] btrfs_sync_fs+0x5a/0xc0 [btrfs]
	[<ffffffff811c3900>] sync_fs_one_sb+0x20/0x30
	[<ffffffff8119768a>] iterate_supers+0xfa/0x100
	[<ffffffff811c3a95>] sys_sync+0x55/0x90
	[<ffffffff816d37dd>] system_call_fastpath+0x1a/0x1f
	[<ffffffffffffffff>] 0xffffffffffffffff

	nitro@core:~$ sync; time sync; time sync 

	real	0m19.202s
	user	0m0.004s
	sys	0m0.024s

	real	0m16.882s
	user	0m0.000s
	sys	0m0.028s

Running iostat also points at a problem, note the %utilization column:

	$ iostat -ctx -p sda 1

## Checking btrfs sync on another drive

To make sure it's not a btrfs problem, I checked another traditional harddrive and it behaved as expected.  The filesystem is nearly 2TB and syncs instantly... why doesn't my SSD sync in a reasonable amount of time?

	$ sudo sh -c "( time btrfs filesystem sync /mnt/massive ; time btrfs filesystem sync /mnt/massive )"
	FSSync '/mnt/massive'

	real	0m0.001s
	user	0m0.000s
	sys	0m0.000s
	FSSync '/mnt/massive'

	real	0m0.001s
	user	0m0.000s
	sys	0m0.000s

## Applying the fix

I deleted the discard option from my mount options and now performance is back to this:

	$ mount
	/dev/sda5 on / type btrfs (rw,noatime,nodiratime,subvol=@,discard)

	$ sudo sh -c "( time btrfs filesystem sync / ; time btrfs filesystem sync / )"
	FSSync '/'

	real    0m0.119s
	user    0m0.000s
	sys     0m0.000s
	FSSync '/'

	real    0m0.105s
	user    0m0.000s
	sys     0m0.000s

And I was happy once again.  I'm sure ext4 would behave the same way.  I think I'm going to setup a cron script to run <code>fstrim /</code> once a week or so to free up the deleted blocks.


## Drive Information

For the record, here's the information about my drive.  Still not sure if discard flag is supposed to behave like this, I suspect it might be buggy firmware on my old SSD, but I don't have any newer more modern SSDs to compare it to.  I updated from v1.10 firmware to v1.37 firmware and it appears to make no change.  Also the <code>Data Set Management TRIM supported (limit 1 block)</code> is interesting.  It appears newer higher performance drives have a higher block limit.
