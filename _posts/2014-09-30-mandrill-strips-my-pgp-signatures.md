## ChicagoVPS Is Terrible

Over the years I've adventured from colo (to much work for what I was doing) to Dreamhost (to slow and restrictive) to cheap VPS and most recently to Digital Ocean.  My stuff is scattered all over as I slowly coalesce it to a sane solution.

This is a story about my mail server still hosted on ChicagoVPS,  which is the worst provider I've ever used (never mind the VPS being down for **days** after a hack with no feedback).  I don't expect *fanatical* service, but I expect a reply in a reasonable time frame (read: 10s of hours) and resolution shortly thereafter.  None of my issues were due to things I was doing and also affected all other users on the same host or network. I didn't expect special treatment.

I didn't get what I expected, so instead I did what any responsible person would do: opened a support ticket (a few), replied (too many times), asked for a resolution (such a demand), and finally took to the Internet to warn others.  I posted on [LowEndtalk forum about the blacklist](http://lowendtalk.com/discussion/33977/providers-subnet-is-in-a-spam-rbl-par-for-the-course-for-lebs).  Much to my surprise, many people proposed a now obvious solution: use a free transactional email relay.  To this day the server is still [blacklisted](http://www.spamhaus.org/sbl/query/SBL225915), but they did give me 3 months of free service after I demanded it.  I doubt I'll use it though at this rate.

I'm not really a web guy, but in the past few years things like Mandrill, Mailgun, Mailjet and SendGrid have materialized as pointed out by the replies on LowEndTalk.  Best part is that they have free mail tiers.  Awesome for the less then 200 emails my server would send a month.  Sign up for Mandrill (because when I'm sending only 200 free emails a month 12k free emails sounds awesome, right?).  Setup my postfix relayhost.  Profit?  Not so fast.


## Issues With Mandrill

At first I very closely monitored all my mail logs.  The test process went something like this:

1. Send a test email.
2. Watch my mail server relay it to Mandrill.
3. Watch Mandrill send it out to destination server.
4. Watch the logs on destination server to see it arrive.
5. Review the slick web interface saying "delivered".

Except, that's not quite how it worked.  Instead, step #5 occurs before step #3.  Not cool.  Turns out [someone on reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/2dq4qy/dont_trust_mandrill_email_service_here_is_why/) observed the same thing.  That user goes as far as to say email was "lost" which is indeed scary.  I haven't lost any emails as of yet (90% of my Mandrill volume to date was testing).

It's a free service.  There is probably some database *eventual consistency* issue or something (not really logical, right?).  Shrug, it was free and better then getting kicked in the face by ChicagoVPS + SpamHaus RBL.


## Mandrill + multipart/signed

One day (today) I attempted to send a gpg signed email.  Why? Because it excites me in ways only cypherpunks will understand.  To test my mutt + gpg setup I sent a gpg signed email to my gmail address.  The body made it, but the signature did not.  Turns out Mandrill strips the signature out.  Their API log JSON blobs show the email as arriving with a PGP signature, however when they get to gmail it's gone.  Gmail's fault? Nope, disabling the Mandrill relayhost on my mail server results in a proper PGP email in my gmail inbox.  Smoking gun.  Mandrill is misbehaving, again.

Since this blog is read by practically nobody (I don't expect people to listen to my babbling in person let alone on the Internet), the following serves primarily as my public bug report since Mandrill seems to have no way for free tier users to report issues.  Shame, since this seems like a legitimate problem.

## Solution? Try Another

Started off with Mailgun since it was hosted by Rackspace and probably run right.  Wrong, my account was flagged and needed "business verification".  I emailed support and charged on to the next service.  Several minutes later support had replied linking to their support site, but I had moved on.  Impressive to get an email back from support at 11 pm PDT.

Next, was SendGrid, their website seemed awkward.  Registration was easy and there was some "verification" step that needed to occur.  I assume it was some human okaying my account.  Again I got annoyed and charged on.  Several mintues later it too claimed to be ready, but I had already moved on.

Finally, I tried [Mailjet](https://www.mailjet.com/).  Their website seems more feature-ful, kind of sluggish due to over design and what not.  Registration was painless, and I was able to verify my account quickly.  Updated postfix configuration and placed a temporary magic text in the top-level of my website to prove ownership of my domain and was sending mail.  Tested mutt + pgp to gmail and it just worked.  Done.  Profit, finally.  In the meantime, the other accounts managed to activate themselves, too little too late for my needs.  Finished off the night with DKIM and SPF records so that they can propagate while I sleep.

## Final Solution?

Once DigitalOcean adds IPv6 support to their SFO data center, I'll move my mail server there (into a CoreOS service) and get rid of my dependence on ChicagoVPS.  At that point, I'll no longer be blacklisted and could then decide if I want to keep or drop Mailjet.  If it continues to work flawlessly, I might as well keep it.


## Update 2014.10.08

I soon realized that Mailjet requires me to verify *every* sending domain.  All of my servers that send cron emails need to be individually verified for *every* hostname.  Sigh.  I don't want to rewrite or forge the sender address (spammers would forge the header, so this policy is ridiculous anyways...), I'd rather see cron emails from user@hostname.full.tld.  I went through the process of activating my Mailgun account and using and that seems better for the moment.  I wish they would have cleaned-up the mail headers that leak too much data though... but it works the best so far.

In other news, ColoCrossing finally was removed from the blacklist.  I received this nice little email from MxToolbox informing me:

64 days later.

I'll stick with Mailgun for now.  Hopefully Mandrill will fix their stuff as their service seemed better overall (multiple SMTP logins so each server could connect directly to their endpoints without sharing credentials).

In other news, I bet ChicagoVPS will never close my ticket eventhough the issue is (temporarily?) resolved.
